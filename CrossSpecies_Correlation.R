#[Wan, et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107908) performed multi method co-expression network analysis  followed by differential analysis and found 30 co-expression modules related LOAD pathology from human cohort study. Among the 30 aggregate co-expression modules, five consensus clusters have been described by Wan, et al. These consensus clusters consist of a subset of modules which are associated with similar AD related changes across the multiple studies and brain regions.

#There are two approaches that we adopted to compute correlation between mouse data with human AD modules:
  
  ### Correlation with human AD modules using logFC values
